This repo is an edited version of rombus (https://github.com/ADACS-Australia/Rombus), a generalised reduced order modelling code. The code presented in this repo makes tweaks to rombus to make it better suited for constructing the largest and most accurate reduced order models currently possible for gravitational waveforms in next-generation gravitational wave detectors. I fixed a number of bugs in rombus parallelisation procedure, as well as providing GW specific functionality to enable the construction of reduced order models. The results of my work are available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04073.
